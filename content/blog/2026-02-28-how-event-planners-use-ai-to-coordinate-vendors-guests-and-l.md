Running an event is like conducting an orchestra where half the musicians haven't met each other, the venue keeps changing the setlist, and your guests are texting you questions from three different countries. Whether you're coordinating a 200-person corporate conference or a high-end wedding weekend, the logistics alone can consume 60–70% of your working hours — most of it repetitive, manual, and frankly exhausting. AI automation is changing that. Not by replacing your expertise or your relationships, but by handling the relentless coordination work that fills your inbox and fragments your attention. Here's how smart event planners are using it right now.

## Automating Vendor Communication Without Losing the Personal Touch

Every event involves a cast of vendors — caterers, AV technicians, florists, photographers, transport companies — each with their own timelines, confirmation requirements, and last-minute queries. Managing them manually means chasing emails, resending briefs, and manually updating spreadsheets every time something shifts.

AI agents can sit between your project management tool (like Asana or Monday.com) and your email, automatically sending vendor briefings when a task reaches a certain stage, chasing confirmations after 48 hours of silence, and updating your central timeline when a vendor replies with a confirmed time. The AI doesn't just send generic follow-ups — you can train it on your own communication style and standard templates so every message sounds like you wrote it.

The time saving here is significant. Event planners typically spend 8–12 hours per event on vendor email coordination alone. Automating the routine touchpoints — confirmations, reminders, schedule updates — can cut that to under 3 hours, freeing you for relationship management and problem-solving instead of inbox firefighting.

One practical example: **Mosaic Events**, a mid-sized UK event management firm handling 40–60 corporate events per year, implemented an AI-powered workflow that connected their CRM to their email platform. When a vendor was added to an event in their system, the AI automatically sent a personalised welcome brief, followed by a confirmation request, and then a pre-event checklist 72 hours before the date. Their event coordinators reported saving an average of 6 hours per event on vendor admin — across 50 events annually, that's 300 hours recovered, equivalent to roughly 7.5 working weeks.

## Handling Guest Communication at Scale

Guest management is where event planners lose the most time to repetitive, low-value work. Registration confirmations, dietary preference collection, schedule reminders, venue directions, parking information, last-minute RSVP changes — each of these is simple in isolation, but multiply them across 150 guests and you're looking at a substantial operational burden.

AI can automate the entire guest communication sequence from registration through to post-event follow-up. Once a guest registers (via your event platform, whether that's Eventbrite, Cvent, or a custom form), an AI workflow can trigger a personalised confirmation, send a dietary or accessibility questionnaire, add the guest to appropriate communication groups (VIP, speaker, general attendee), and queue up a series of pre-event reminders — all without you touching a single email.

Where this becomes genuinely powerful is in handling inbound queries. AI-powered chatbots integrated into your event website or WhatsApp channel can answer 80–90% of common guest questions — parking, dress code, agenda timings, accommodation options — instantly, at any hour. This is especially valuable for international events where guests are spread across time zones and your team isn't available at 2am to answer whether the gala dinner is black tie.

The numbers make a compelling case. A typical 150-person corporate event generates 40–60 inbound guest queries in the two weeks before the event. If each takes 5 minutes to handle, that's 3–5 hours of your team's time — for a single event. For a planner running 20 events a year, that's potentially 60–100 hours recovered just from automating guest Q&A.

## Real-Time Logistics Coordination on the Day

Pre-event planning is one challenge; day-of execution is another entirely. This is where things go wrong — suppliers running late, room layouts changing, a keynote speaker needing a last-minute tech setup adjustment. Event planners on the day are effectively crisis managers, and the last thing you need is to also be manually relaying updates to a 12-person vendor team via individual WhatsApp messages.

AI workflows can act as a real-time coordination layer on the day. By connecting your event management software to a shared communication channel (Slack is commonly used for this), you can set up automated alerts that notify relevant vendors the moment a schedule change is logged. If your AV team needs to know a session has moved from 2pm to 2:30pm, the system flags it immediately — you don't need to be the human relay.

Some planners are going further by using AI to monitor live data during events. Integrating with registration check-in systems means your AI can flag in real time if attendance in a particular session is running 40% below expected — giving you the chance to redirect catering resources or adjust room configuration before it becomes a problem. This kind of proactive logistics management, previously only available to large agencies with dedicated operations teams, is now accessible through tools like Zapier, Make (formerly Integromat), or purpose-built event tech platforms.

## Budget Tracking and Post-Event Reconciliation

One of the most time-consuming parts of event management happens after the last guest leaves: reconciling invoices, tracking actuals against budget, and pulling together a post-event report for your client. Planners commonly spend 4–8 hours per event on this work alone — and it's exactly the kind of structured, rule-based task that AI handles well.

AI can be set up to extract key figures from incoming vendor invoices (using a tool like Dext or an AI document processor), match them against your budget tracker automatically, flag any discrepancies for your review, and populate a post-event summary report. Instead of manually cross-referencing 15 invoices against a spreadsheet, you review a pre-populated report and approve it.

Beyond saving time, this reduces errors. Manual reconciliation across a complex event budget — where costs span catering, AV, transport, accommodation, and staffing — is genuinely error-prone. Catching a double-billed invoice or a quantity discrepancy before you pass costs on to your client protects both your margins and your professional reputation.

## Conclusion

AI won't replace what makes a great event planner irreplaceable — your judgment, your vendor relationships, your ability to read a room and pivot under pressure. What it will do is eliminate the hours of coordination work that currently sit between you and the parts of the job you're actually good at. The planners adopting these tools now aren't finding that events feel less personal. They're finding they have more time to make them better. If you're running more than five events a year and still managing vendor follow-ups and guest queries manually, the question isn't whether automation is worth it — it's how much time you've already spent wishing you had it.
