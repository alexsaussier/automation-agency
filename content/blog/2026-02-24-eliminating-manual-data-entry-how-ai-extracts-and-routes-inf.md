Every week, someone on your team is copying information from an email into a spreadsheet, re-typing a client's details from a PDF into your CRM, or manually forwarding a supplier invoice to the accounts folder. It feels like a small thing. Multiply it by fifty invoices, thirty new enquiries, and twenty support requests a week, and you're looking at hours of repetitive work that costs real money and introduces errors that can take days to unravel. AI-powered data extraction and routing is the fix — and it's more accessible than most people realise.

## What "Extracting and Routing" Actually Means

Before we get into the mechanics, let's be precise about what we're talking about. Data extraction means an AI reads an incoming document, email, or form — and pulls out the specific pieces of information you need: a customer name, an invoice total, a date, a product code, a medical referral reason. It understands context, not just keywords, which means it can handle differently formatted documents without you building a separate rule for each one.

Data routing means that once the AI has extracted that information, it automatically sends it to the right place. The invoice total goes into your accounting software. The new client name and email get created as a contact in your CRM. The referral reason gets attached to the correct patient file and triggers a notification to the right clinician.

Together, these two steps replace the human middle layer — the person who reads, interprets, and re-types — with an automated pipeline that runs continuously, without lunch breaks or typos.

The underlying technology is called Intelligent Document Processing (IDP), and modern AI systems can handle structured documents like forms and invoices, semi-structured documents like emails, and even unstructured text like freeform customer messages. Accuracy rates on well-configured systems typically run at 95–99%, which is higher than manual data entry by most benchmarks.

## Where This Saves the Most Time (and Money)

The clearest wins come from high-volume, repetitive document flows. Here are the three areas where businesses consistently see the fastest return:

**Invoice and purchase order processing.** A typical accounts payable team member spends 10–15 minutes manually processing a single invoice — opening it, reading it, checking it against a purchase order, entering line items, coding it to the right cost centre, and filing it. An AI extraction workflow does the same job in under 30 seconds. For a business handling 200 invoices a month, that's a saving of roughly 40–50 hours of staff time per month, or the equivalent of one part-time role dedicated entirely to copying numbers between documents.

**New enquiry and lead intake.** Whether leads arrive via a web form, an email, or a third-party platform, someone has to make sure the right information lands in your CRM and reaches the right person. Manually, this takes 5–10 minutes per lead and introduces the risk of leads going cold because they sat in an inbox over a weekend. An automated extraction-and-routing workflow captures the lead instantly, populates your CRM, assigns it to the correct team member based on location, product interest, or enquiry type, and triggers a follow-up sequence — all before a human has even opened the email.

**Client onboarding documents.** For law firms, financial advisers, and clinics, onboarding involves collecting ID documents, signed agreements, and intake forms, then manually entering details across multiple systems. This process often takes 30–60 minutes per client. Automated extraction can reduce that to a quick review and approval step, cutting admin time by 70–80% per onboarding.

## A Real Example: How a Recruitment Consultancy Automated CV and Brief Intake

A mid-sized recruitment consultancy was processing roughly 300 CVs and 40 new client briefs every week. Their coordinators spent Monday mornings doing nothing but pulling candidate details from CVs and typing them into their ATS (applicant tracking system), and doing the same with client briefs into their CRM. It was consuming two full working days of coordinator time each week.

They implemented an AI extraction workflow using a combination of a document AI tool and an automation platform (similar to what BrightBots deploys for clients). The setup worked like this: CVs sent to a dedicated inbox were automatically read by the AI, which extracted name, contact details, work history, skills, and location, then created or updated a candidate profile in the ATS. Client briefs were processed similarly — the AI extracted the role title, salary range, location, and key requirements, created a new brief record in the CRM, and notified the relevant consultant via Slack.

The result: coordinator time on data entry dropped from two full days to about 90 minutes of exception-handling per week — reviewing the small percentage of documents the AI flagged as ambiguous. That freed the coordinators to spend time on candidate calls and client relationship work, which are the activities that actually generate revenue. The consultancy estimated a saving of approximately £1,800 per month in staff hours, with the automation paying for itself within the first six weeks.

## How to Set This Up Without a Development Team

You don't need to hire a developer or buy enterprise software to make this work. The practical starting point is to identify your single highest-volume document flow — the one that causes the most weekly pain — and build a workflow around that first.

Most AI extraction and routing setups for SMBs and professional services firms are built using a combination of tools that already exist and can be connected:

- **Document AI tools** (such as Google Document AI, AWS Textract, or purpose-built tools like Rossum or Mindee) handle the reading and extraction.
- **Automation platforms** (like Make, Zapier, or n8n) handle the routing — connecting the extracted data to wherever it needs to go.
- **Your existing software** (CRM, accounting tool, project management platform) receives the data via integration.

A well-scoped first workflow typically takes one to three weeks to build and test, depending on complexity. The key to getting a good result quickly is to define your outputs before you start: know exactly which fields you need extracted, where each one needs to go, and what should trigger a human to review rather than an automatic route.

Start with documents that are reasonably consistent in format — supplier invoices or a standard enquiry form are ideal. Once that workflow is running reliably, expand to more variable document types.

## Conclusion

Manual data entry isn't just a time drain — it's a structural vulnerability in your business. Every re-typed invoice is a chance for an error. Every lead entered by hand is a chance for a delay that costs you the job. AI-powered extraction and routing removes that vulnerability entirely, replacing a fragile human chain with a consistent, fast, accurate process. The technology is proven, the tools are accessible, and the ROI is measurable within weeks. The question isn't whether your business can afford to do this — it's whether you can afford to keep doing it manually.
